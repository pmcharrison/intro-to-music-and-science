  abstract  = "It is common practice in correlational or quasiexperimental
               studies to use statistical control to remove confounding effects
               from a regression coefficient. Controlling for relevant
               confounders can debias the estimated causal effect of a
               predictor on an outcome; that is, it can bring the estimated
               regression coefficient closer to the value of the true causal
               effect. But statistical control works only under ideal
               circumstances. When the selected control variables are
               inappropriate, controlling can result in estimates that are more
               biased than uncontrolled estimates. Despite the ubiquity of
               statistical control in published regression analyses and the
               consequences of controlling for inappropriate third variables,
               the selection of control variables is rarely explicitly
               justified in print. We argue that to carefully select
               appropriate control variables, researchers must propose and
               defend a causal structure that includes the outcome, predictors,
               and plausible confounders. We underscore the importance of
               causality when selecting control variables by demonstrating how
               regression coefficients are affected by controlling for
               appropriate and inappropriate variables. Finally, we provide
               practical recommendations for applied researchers who wish to
               use statistical control.",

  abstract = "One reason for the universal appeal of music lies in the
              emotional rewards that music offers to its listeners. But what
              makes these rewards so special? The authors addressed this
              question by progressively characterizing music-induced emotions
              in 4 interrelated studies. Studies 1 and 2 (n=354) were conducted
              to compile a list of music-relevant emotion terms and to study
              the frequency of both felt and perceived emotions across 5 groups
              of listeners with distinct music preferences. Emotional responses
              varied greatly according to musical genre and type of response
              (felt vs. perceived). Study 3 (n=801)--a field study carried out
              during a music festival--examined the structure of music-induced
              emotions via confirmatory factor analysis of emotion ratings,
              resulting in a 9-factorial model of music-induced emotions. Study
              4 (n=238) replicated this model and found that it accounted for
              music-elicited emotions better than the basic emotion and
              dimensional emotion models. A domain-specific device to measure
              musically induced emotions is introduced--the Geneva Emotional

  title    = "The magical number seven, plus or minus two: some limits on our
              capacity for processing information",
  author   = "Miller, G A",
  abstract = "First, the span of absolute judgment and the span of immediate
              memory impose severe limitations on the amount of information
              that we are able to receive, process, and remember. By organizing
              the stimulus input simultaneously into several dimensions and
              successively into a sequence or chunks, we manage to break (or at
              least stretch) this informational bottleneck. Second, the process
              of recoding is a very important one in human psychology and
              deserves much more explicit attention than it has received. In
              particular, the kind of linguistic recoding that people do seems
              to me to be the very lifeblood of the thought processes. Recoding
              procedures are a constant concern to clinicians, social
              psychologists, linguists, and anthropologists and yet, probably
              because recoding is less accessible to experimental manipulation
              than nonsense syllables or T mazes, the traditional experimental
              psychologist has contributed little or nothing to their analysis.
              Nevertheless, experimental techniques can be used, methods of
              recoding can be specified, behavioral indicants can be found. And
              I anticipate that we will find a very orderly set of relations
              describing what now seems an uncharted wilderness of individual
              differences. Third, the concepts and measures provided by the
              theory of information provide a quantitative way of getting at
              some of these questions. The theory provides us with a yardstick
              for calibrating our stimulus materials and for measuring the
              performance of our subjects. In the interests of communication I
              have suppressed the technical details of information measurement
              and have tried to express the ideas in more familiar terms; I
              hope this paraphrase will not lead you to think they are not
              useful in research. Informational concepts have already proved
              valuable in the study of discrimination and of language; they
              promise a great deal in the study of learning and memory; and it
              has even been proposed that they can be useful in the study of
              concept formation. A lot of questions that seemed fruitless
              twenty or thirty years ago may now be worth another look. In
              fact, I feel that my story here must stop just as it begins to
              get really interesting. And finally, what about the magical
              number seven? What about the seven wonders of the world, the
              seven seas, the seven deadly sins, the seven daughters of Atlas
              in the Pleiades, the seven ages of man, the seven levels of hell,
              the seven primary colors, the seven notes of the musical scale,
              and the seven days of the week? What about the seven-point rating
              scale, the seven categories for absolute judgment, the seven
              objects in the span of attention, and the seven digits in the
              span of immediate memory? For the present I propose to withhold
              judgment. Perhaps there is something deep and profound behind all
              these sevens, something just calling out for us to discover it.
              But I suspect that it is only a pernicious, Pythagorean
              coincidence.",

  abstract = "The human brain has often been viewed as outstanding among
              mammalian brains: the most cognitively able, the
              largest-than-expected from body size, endowed with an
              overdeveloped cerebral cortex that represents over 80\% of brain
              mass, and purportedly containing 100 billion neurons and 10x more
              glial cells. Such uniqueness was seemingly necessary to justify
              the superior cognitive abilities of humans over larger-brained
              mammals such as elephants and whales. However, our recent studies
              using a novel method to determine the cellular composition of the
              brain of humans and other primates as well as of rodents and
              insectivores show that, since different cellular scaling rules
              apply to the brains within these orders, brain size can no longer
              be considered a proxy for the number of neurons in the brain.
              These studies also showed that the human brain is not exceptional
              in its cellular composition, as it was found to contain as many
              neuronal and non-neuronal cells as would be expected of a primate
              brain of its size. Additionally, the so-called overdeveloped
              human cerebral cortex holds only 19\% of all brain neurons, a
              fraction that is similar to that found in other mammals. In what
              regards absolute numbers of neurons, however, the human brain
              does have two advantages compared to other mammalian brains:
              compared to rodents, and probably to whales and elephants as
              well, it is built according to the very economical, space-saving
              scaling rules that apply to other primates; and, among
              economically built primate brains, it is the largest, hence
              containing the most neurons. These findings argue in favor of a
              view of cognitive abilities that is centered on absolute numbers
              of neurons, rather than on body size or encephalization, and call
              for a re-examination of several concepts related to the
              exceptionality of the human brain.",

               learners, performers, facilitators, composers, arts
               administrators, and educators. It can emerge, for example, from
               music teachers trying out new teaching methods, performers
               wishing to know more about how to improvise effectively,
               educators pursuing the most effective ways to structure music
               curricula, musicians aiming to explain why their music enhances
               wellbeing among different groups of people, and orchestral
               managers seeking to promote and protect the health of their
               players. At the heart of all of these enquiries lies a question
               of some sort, and it is these research questions that determine
               the direction of the research to be undertaken. Performing Music
               Research is a comprehensive guide to planning, conducting,
               analyzing, and communicating research in music performance. The
               book examines the approaches and strategies that underpin
               research in music education, psychology, and performance
               science. It reviews the knowledge and skills needed to critique
               existing studies in these fields and to design and carry out new
               investigations. Perspectives on qualitative, quantitative, and
               multistrategy methodologies are highlighted across the book in
               ways that help aspiring researchers bring precision to their
               research questions, select methods that are appropriate for
               addressing their questions, and apply those methods

               might arise more simply from constraints on melodic ranginess or

               tessitura, and from those extremes a melody has little choice

               vocal melodies from four different continents are consistent
               with this simple explanation. The results suggest that, in the
               sampled repertoires, patterns such as ``gap-fill,'' ``registral
               direction,'' and ``registral return'' (L. Meyer, 1956, 1973; E.

              explicated using experimentally established perceptual

              contemporary music theory tracts. These principles are treated in
              a manner akin to axioms in a formal system from which the
              traditional rules of voice-leading are derived. Nontraditional
              rules aris- ing from the derivation are shown to predict formerly
              unnoticed aspects of voice-leading practice. In addition to the
              core perceptual principles, several auxiliary principles are
              described. These auxiliary principles are occasionally linked to
              voice-leading practice and may be regarded as com- positional
              ``options'' that shape the music-making in perceptually unique

Participants were asked to evaluate the tension created by a chord X in sequences of three chords [C major--{\textgreater}X--{\textgreater}C major] in a C major context key. The X chords could be major or minor triads major-minor seventh, or minor seventh chords built on the 12 notes of the chromatic scale. The data were compared with Krumhansl's (1990) harmonic hierarchy and with predictions of Lerdahl's (1988) cognitive theory, Hutchinson and Knopoff's (1978) and Parncutt's (1989) sensory-psychoacoustical theories, and the model of horizontal motion defined in the paper. As a main outcome, it appears that judgments of tension arose from a convergence of several cognitive and psychoacoustics influences, whose relative importance varies, depending on musical training.},

abstract = {In this paper, a roughness model, which is based on human auditory perception (HAP) and known as HAP-RM, is developed for the sound quality evaluation (SQE) of vehicle noise. First, the interior noise signals are measured for a sample vehicle and prepared for roughness modelling. The HAP-RM model is based on the process of sound transfer and perception in the human auditory system by combining the structural filtering function and nonlinear perception characteristics of the ear. The HAP-RM model is applied to the measured vehicle interior noise signals by considering the factors that affect hearing, such as the modulation and carrier frequencies, the time and frequency maskings and the correlations of the critical bands. The HAP-RM model is validated by jury tests. An anchor-scaled scoring method (ASM) is used for subjective evaluations in the jury tests. The verification results show that the novel developed model can accurately calculate vehicle noise roughness below 0.6 asper. Further investigation shows that the total roughness of the vehicle interior noise can mainly be attributed to frequency components below 12 Bark. The time masking effects of the modelling procedure enable the application of the HAP-RM model to stationary and nonstationary vehicle noise signals and the SQE of other sound-related signals in engineering problems.},

  abstract = "Simultaneous consonance is a salient perceptual phenomenon
              corresponding to the perceived pleasantness of simultaneously
              sounding musical tones. Various competing theories of consonance
              have been proposed over the centuries, but recently a consensus
              has developed that simultaneous consonance is primarily driven by
              harmonicity perception. Here we question this view,
              substantiating our argument by critically reviewing historic
              consonance research from a broad variety of disciplines,
              reanalyzing consonance perception data from 4 previous behavioral
              studies representing more than 500 participants, and modeling
              three Western musical corpora representing more than 100,000
              compositions. We conclude that simultaneous consonance is a
              composite phenomenon that derives in large part from three
              phenomena: interference, periodicity/harmonicity, and cultural
              familiarity. We formalize this conclusion with a computational
              model that predicts a musical chord's simultaneous consonance
              from these three features, and release this model in an
              open-source R package, incon, alongside 15 other computational
              models also evaluated in this paper. We hope that this package
              will facilitate further psychological and musicological research

               detectable above 3.5 kHz which is about 1 octave lower than in
               the cat, squirrel monkey and some birds. Direct measurements of
               the cochlear afferent fibre synaptic delay are consistent with
               indirect estimates from phase-locking, both giving values of
               0.7-0.8 ms. Measurements of the receptor potentials of inner
               hair-cells in the guinea pig cochlea indicate that as the

               in the a.c. component compared to the steady depolarization. The

               status, intelligence, motivation and prior academic achievement.
               Data were collected from 110 adolescents at two time points,
               once when the students were between 11 and 14 years old in the
               seventh grade, and again 3 years later. Our results show that
               music students perform better academically than non-music
               students in the seventh grade (Cohen's d = 0.88) and in the
               ninth grade (Cohen's d = 1.05). This difference is particularly
               evident in their scores in Portuguese language and natural

               geography scores, and is least pronounced in mathematics and

              auditory-cognitive abilities have either experienced mixed
              success or remain to be fully validated. The limited benefits of
              such regimens are largely attributable to our weak understanding
              of (i) how (and which) interventions provide the most robust and
              long lasting improvements to cognitive and perceptual abilities
              and (ii) how the neural mechanisms which underlie such abilities
              are positively modified by certain activities and experience.
              Recent studies indicate that music training provides robust,
              long-lasting biological benefits to auditory function.
              Importantly, the behavioral advantages conferred by musical
              experience extend beyond simple enhancements to perceptual
              abilities and even impact non-auditory functions necessary for
              higher-order aspects of cognition (e.g., working memory,
              intelligence). Collectively, preliminary findings indicate that
              alternative forms of arts engagement (e.g., visual arts training)
              may not yield such widespread enhancements, suggesting that music
              expertise uniquely taps and refines a hierarchy of brain networks
              subserving a variety of auditory as well as domain-general
              cognitive mechanisms. We infer that transfer from specific music
              experience to broad cognitive benefit might be mediated by the
              degree to which a listener's musical training tunes lower- (e.g.,
              perceptual) and higher-order executive functions, and the
              coordination between these processes. Ultimately, understanding
              the broad impact of music on the brain will not only provide a
              more holistic picture of auditory processing and plasticity, but
              may help inform and tailor remediation and training programs
              designed to improve perceptual and cognitive benefits in human

  abstract  = "Information theory and inference, often taught separately, are
               here united in one entertaining textbook. These topics lie at
               the heart of many exciting areas of contemporary science and
               engineering - communication, signal processing, data mining,
               machine learning, pattern recognition, computational
               neuroscience, bioinformatics, and cryptography. This textbook
               introduces theory in tandem with applications. Information
               theory is taught alongside practical communication systems, such
               as arithmetic coding for data compression and sparse-graph codes
               for error-correction. A toolbox of inference techniques,
               including message-passing algorithms, Monte Carlo methods, and
               variational approximations, are developed alongside applications
               of these tools to clustering, convolutional codes, independent
               component analysis, and neural networks. The final part of the
               book describes the state of the art in error-correcting codes,
               including low-density parity-check codes, turbo codes, and
               digital fountain codes -- the twenty-first century standards for
               satellite communications, disk drives, and data broadcast.
               Richly illustrated, filled with worked examples and over 400
               exercises, some with detailed solutions, David MacKay's
               groundbreaking book is ideal for self-learning and for
               undergraduate or graduate courses. Interludes on crosswords,
               evolution, and sex provide entertainment along the way. In sum,
               this is a textbook on information, communication, and coding for
               a new generation of students, and an unparalleled entry point
               into these subjects for professionals in areas as diverse as
               computational biology, financial engineering, and machine
               learning.",

              populations that we sample. However, most research published in

               that college students who listened to the first 10 minutes of a
               Mozart sonata (K.448) scored higher on a spatial-temporal
               reasoning task immediately afterward---an effect that lasted
               approximately 10 minutes. This chapter presents the school
               district of Kettle-Moraine study. Children from four
               kindergarten classrooms at two Wisconsin public elementary
               schools in the school district of Kettle-Moraine participated.
               Some children received piano keyboard instruction (keyboard
               group) and others received no special training (no music group).
               The study began by pretesting all the children using two
               spatial-temporal tasks, a puzzle-solving task, a block-building
               task, and one pictorial memory task. Children were posttested
               twice, once following 4 months of lessons and a second time
               following 8 months. Results showed that young children who were
               provided with music instruction scored higher on
               spatial-temporal tasks compared with children who did not
               receive the instruction. The effect was significant after 4
               months of instruction. No enhancement was found for a nonspatial
               task: pictorial memory. However, when the music instruction was
               terminated the children's scores began to decrease. The children
               who received instruction over the entire 4 years of the study
               continued to score higher on the spatial-temporal tasks. The
               effects of music instruction on spatial-temporal abilities may
               be explained by two types of theories. Neuroscientific theories
               assert that music instruction induces physiological changes in
               brain structure that consequently affect spatial-temporal
               processing. Transfer theories, on the other hand, suggest that
               playing a musical instrument and performing a spatial-temporal
               task require similar cognitive skills, and thus the skills
               involved in making music may transfer to spatial-temporal task
               performance.",

  abstract = "Playing a musical instrument is associated with numerous neural
              processes that continuously modify the human brain and may
              facilitate characteristic auditory skills. In a longitudinal
              study, we investigated the auditory and neural plasticity of
              musical learning in 111 young children (aged 7-9 y) as a function
              of the intensity of instrumental practice and musical aptitude.
              Because of the frequent co-occurrence of central auditory
              processing disorders and attentional deficits, we also tested 21
              children with attention deficit (hyperactivity) disorder
              [AD(H)D]. Magnetic resonance imaging and magnetoencephalography
              revealed enlarged Heschl's gyri and enhanced right-left
              hemispheric synchronization of the primary evoked response (P1)
              to harmonic complex sounds in children who spent more time
              practicing a musical instrument. The anatomical characteristics
              were positively correlated with frequency discrimination,
              reading, and spelling skills. Conversely, AD(H)D children showed
              reduced volumes of Heschl's gyri and enhanced volumes of the
              plana temporalia that were associated with a distinct bilateral
              P1 asynchrony. This may indicate a risk for central auditory
              processing disorders that are often associated with attentional
              and literacy problems. The longitudinal comparisons revealed a
              very high stability of auditory cortex morphology and gray matter
              volumes, suggesting that the combined anatomical and functional
              parameters are neural markers of musicality and attention

              A multilevel meta-analysis",
  author   = "Sala, Giovanni and Gobet, Fernand",
  abstract = "Music training has repeatedly been claimed to positively impact
              children's cognitive skills and academic achievement (literacy
              and mathematics). This claim relies on the assumption that
              engaging in intellectually demanding activities fosters
              particular domain-general cognitive skills, or even general
              intelligence. The present meta-analytic review (N = 6,984, k =
              254, m = 54) shows that this belief is incorrect. Once the
              quality of study design is controlled for, the overall effect of
              music training programs is null ([Formula: see text] $\approx$ 0)
              and highly consistent across studies ($\tau$2 $\approx$ 0).
              Results of Bayesian analyses employing distributional assumptions
              (informative priors) derived from previous research in cognitive
              training corroborate these conclusions. Small statistically
              significant overall effects are obtained only in those studies
              implementing no random allocation of participants and employing
              non-active controls ([Formula: see text] $\approx$ 0.200, p <
              .001). Interestingly, music training is ineffective regardless of
              the type of outcome measure (e.g., verbal, non-verbal,
              speed-related, etc.), participants' age, and duration of
              training. Furthermore, we note that, beyond meta-analysis of
              experimental studies, a considerable amount of cross-sectional
              evidence indicates that engagement in music has no impact on
              people's non-music cognitive skills or academic achievement. We
              conclude that researchers' optimism about the benefits of music
              training is empirically unjustified and stems from
              misinterpretation of the empirical data and, possibly,
              confirmation bias.",

               personality and the culture in which we were raised? Why do
               certain songs remind us so strongly of particular people,
               places, or events? How can music be therapeutically used to help
               those with autism, Parkinson's, and other medical conditions?
               The Science and Psychology of Music: From Beethoven at the
               Office to Beyonc{\'e} at the Gym answers these and other
               questions.This book provides a broad and accessible introduction
               to the fascinating field of music psychology. Despite its name,
               music psychology includes a number of fields, including
               neuroscience, psychology, social psychology, sociology, and
               health. Through a collection of thematically organized chapters,
               readers will discover how our brains recognize elements of
               music, how music can affect us and shape our identities, and the
               many real-world applications for such information.Explores a
               topic that is of great interest to both psychology students and
               the general public through accessible and engaging
               contentProvides a conceptual framework for readers and through a
               multi-part format allows them to focus their attention on their
               particular areas of interestFurthers readers' understanding of
               how music can affect our wellbeing as it includes both our

  abstract  = "The Psychology of Music draws together the diverse and scattered
               literature on the psychology of music. It explores the way music
               is processed by the listener and the performer and considers
               several issues that are of importance both to perceptual
               psychology and to contemporary music, such as the way the sound
               of an instrument is identified regardless of its pitch or
               loudness, or the types of information that can be discarded in
               the synthetic replication of a sound without distorting
               perceived timbre. Comprised of 18 chapters, this book begins
               with a review of the classical psychoacoustical literature on
               tone perception, focusing on characteristics of particular
               relevance to music. The attributes of pitch, loudness, and
               timbre are examined, and a summary of research methods in
               psychoacoustics is presented. Subsequent chapters deal with
               timbre perception; the subjective effects of different sound
               fields; temporal aspects of music; abstract structures formed by
               pitch relationships in music; different tests of musical
               ability; and the importance of abstract structural
               representation in understanding how music is performed. The
               final chapter evaluates the relationship between new music and
               psychology. This monograph should be a valuable resource for
               psychologists and musicians.",

               modeling is generally regarded as one of the three main
               approaches along with experimental psychology and

               ``cognitive science.'' It is no surprise, then, that
               computational work has become an important part of the field of
               music cognition as well. What follows is a survey of some
               important research in computational modeling of music cognition.
               We begin with problems of perception or information
               processing---problems of extracting various kinds of information
               from music as it is heard. Here we focus primarily on two
               especially well-studied problems, keyfinding and meter-finding,
               but briefly consider several other problems as well. We then
               turn to three other broad issues: the modeling of musical
               experience, the modeling of performance, and the modeling of
               composition. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights

  title    = "A probabilistic model of melody perception",

  abstract = "This study presents a probabilistic model of melody perception,
              which infers the key of a melody and also judges the probability
              of the melody itself. The model uses Bayesian reasoning: For any
              ``surface'' pattern and underlying ``structure,'' we can infer
              the structure maximizing P(structure|surface) based on knowledge
              of P(surface, structure). The probability of the surface can then
              be calculated as $\sum$ P(surface, structure), summed over all
              structures. In this case, the surface is a pattern of notes; the
              structure is a key. A generative model is proposed, based on
              three principles: (a) melodies tend to remain within a narrow
              pitch range; (b) note-to-note intervals within a melody tend to
              be small; and (c) notes tend to conform to a distribution (or key
              profile) that depends on the key. The model is tested in three
              ways. First, it is tested on its ability to identify the keys of
              a set of folksong melodies. Second, it is tested on a melodic
              expectation task in which it must judge the probability of
              different notes occurring given a prior context; these judgments
              are compared with perception data from a melodic expectation
              experiment. Finally, the model is tested on its ability to detect
              incorrect notes in melodies by assigning them lower probabilities
              than the original versions.",

  author   = "Pearce, Marcus T",
  abstract = "The prevalent approach to developing cognitive models of music
              perception and composition is to construct systems of symbolic
              rules and constraints on the basis of extensive music-theoretic
              and music-analytic knowledge. The the- sis proposed in this
              dissertation is that statistical models which acquire knowl- edge
              through the induction of regularities in corpora of existing
              music can, if examined with appropriate methodologies, provide
              significant insights into the cognitive processing involved in
              music perception and composition. This claim is examined in three
              stages. First, a number of statistical modelling techniques drawn
              from the fields of data compression, statistical language
              modelling and machine learning are subjected to empirical
              evaluation in the context of se- quential prediction of pitch
              structure in unseen melodies. This investigation results in a
              collection of modelling strategies which together yield
              significant performance improvements over existing methods. In
              the second stage, these statistical systems are used to examine
              observed patterns of expectation col- lected in previous
              psychological research on melody perception. In contrast to
              previous accounts of this data, the results demonstrate that
              these patterns of expectation can be accounted for in terms of
              the induction of statistical regu- larities acquired through
              exposure to music. In the final stage of the present research,
              the statistical systems developed in the first stage are used to
              examine the intrinsic computational demands of the task of
              composing a stylistically suc- cessful melody. The results
              suggest that the systems lack the degree of expres- sive power
              needed to consistently meet the demands of the task. In contrast
              to previous research, however, the methodological framework
              developed for the evaluation of computationalmodels of
              composition enables a detailed empirical examination and
              comparison of suchmodels which facilitates the identification and
              resolution of their weaknesses.",

              corresponding to the perceived pleasantness of simultaneously
              sounding musical tones. Various competing theories of consonance
              have been proposed over the centuries, but recently a consensus
              has developed that simultaneous consonance is primarily driven by
              harmonicity perception. Here we question this view,
              substantiating our argument by critically reviewing historic
              consonance research from a broad variety of disciplines,
              reanalyzing consonance perception data from 4 previous behavioral
              studies representing more than 500 participants, and modeling
              three Western musical corpora representing more than 100,000
              compositions. We conclude that simultaneous consonance is a
              composite phenomenon that derives in large part from three
              phenomena: interference, periodicity/harmonicity, and cultural
              familiarity. We formalize this conclusion with a computational
              model that predicts a musical chord's simultaneous consonance
              from these three features, and release this model in an
              open-source R package, incon, alongside 15 other computational
              models also evaluated in this paper. We hope that this package
              will facilitate further psychological and musicological research

              dimensions or using no measure at all. To meet the need for a
              very brief measure, 5 and 10-item inventories were developed and
              evaluated. Although somewhat inferior to standard multi-item
              instruments, the instruments reached adequate levels in terms of:
              (a) convergence with widely used Big-Five measures in self,
