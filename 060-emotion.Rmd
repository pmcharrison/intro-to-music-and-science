## Introduction to emotion and music

We're very used to describing emotions with language. We have many
different words to use, each of which evokes a particular facet of human
emotional experience. If I say the word 'disgust', you know exactly what
I mean -- that feeling when I bite into a rotten apple, or open the
rubbish bin, or step in dog faeces. If I say the word 'amazement', you
likewise know instantly what I'm talking about: a special combination of
surprise and disbelief.

Music's capacity to express emotion is very different. On the one hand,
it lacks some of the expressive specificity of language. It's quite hard
to write a melody that unambiguously connotes the emotion of 'disgust',
for example.

Music does have some special advantages in its relationship with
emotion, though. One feature is a particularly strong power to induce
certain emotions in the audience. This feature underpins ways in which
music is used across the world, for example in the context of lullabies,
love songs, war songs, and religious ceremonies. In Western society, we
regularly experience this emotional power in the context of TV and film.
As audience members, we are so used to our emotions being manipulated in
this way that we barely notice it any more.

This power of emotion induction becomes particularly interesting when
the music is created interactively by several people playing or singing
together. The music becomes a vehicle both for expressing one's own
emotions, and for experiencing emotions expressed by others in the
group. The result is a special kind of shared, synchronous emotional
experience.

We're going to focus on a few key topics in this chapter. We'll start by
covering definitions of core concepts, such as emotion, mood, and
affect. We'll go through several current psychological models of
emotion, some of which are general psychological models, and some of
which are specific to aesthetics or to music. We'll discuss various
methods for studying emotions in laboratory contexts, many of which are
well-suited to musical applications. Finally, we'll discuss specific
mechanisms by which music induces emotion.

### Definitions

Many scientific terms related to emotion do have intuitive meanings from
day-to-day life. We do have to be careful though when we apply these
terms in a scientific context -- we need to be quite precise about what
we mean, otherwise we can end up tying ourselves in knots. This is all
made particularly difficult by the fact that there's still not a
complete scientific consensus about what many of these terms mean.

#### Emotion

The [APA Dictionary of Psychology](https://dictionary.apa.org) defines
emotion as "a complex reaction pattern, involving experiential,
behavioral, and physiological elements, by which an individual attempts
to deal with a personally significant matter or event."

What do we mean by a reaction pattern? Let's take 'fear' as an example.
As stated in the definition, the reaction pattern must comprise three
components: experiential, behavioural, and physiological.

-   The *experiential* component is what the mind has conscious access
    to. When I say "I feel scared", I'm giving a label to the subjective
    experience of fear. Typically the emotion will be grounded in a
    particular object, event, or circumstance. For example, I might
    experience fear of a snake, or fear of stepping onstage to give a
    musical performance.

-   The *behavioural* component concerns what physical actions we
    perform with our body. Experiencing an emotion doesn't mean that we
    have to enact these physical actions; instead, the emotion provides
    a 'tendency' to enact these actions. In the case of fear, one action
    tendency might be to freeze, so that I don't make the situation any
    worse by disturbing the snake. A second action tendency might be to
    make a particular facial expression, to communicate my fear to other
    members of my species (or 'conspecifics', as we can call them). If
    I'm particularly scared, I might also make a vocal expression, like
    a scream. This has a similar function of communicating to
    conspecifics.

-   The *physiological* component prepares the body in various ways for
    future action. In the case of fear, this could mean a raised heart
    rate, increased perspiration, suppressed digestion, and various
    other kinds of things that should help me to respond to the salient
    threat.

We can identify several important functions of these reaction patterns
in survival contexts:

-   One is **preparing the body** for an anticipated future. For
    example, a raised heart rate in the context of fear prepares the
    individual for subsequent physical exertion, so that they can
    overcome the current threat.

-   A second important function is **signalling to others**. This will
    typically be through some combination of facial and verbal
    expressions. Signalling emotions is very useful in a social context;
    it helps individuals to work together to overcome threats, and it
    helps them to build stable social relationships built on mutual
    trust.

-   A third function is **promoting desirable behaviour** in the
    individual. For example, a fear of heights is adaptively useful
    because it discourages me from standing in dangerous locations (such
    as cliff edges) where I might be likely to fall and hurt myself.

Let's revisit the last part of the APA's definition of emotion: "by
which an individual attempts to deal with a personally significant
matter or event". This part of the definition is particularly
controversial in the context of music emotion research, because the
emotions that music induces are generally *not* to do with any
personally significant matter or event. Some people respond by saying
that the definition is at fault, in that it is overly restrictive.
Others respond by saying that musical emotions aren't 'real' emotions,
precisely because they fail to satisfy all of these criteria.

This debate on the validity of musical emotions has a long philosophical
history which we won't dive into here. However, we will suggest a
slightly modified and more inclusive definition of emotion that
sidesteps this controversy: "Emotion is a complex reaction pattern,
involving experiential, behavioural, and physiological elements,
typically (but not exclusively) elicited as a response to a personally
significant matter or event."

#### Mood

Mood is a related concept to emotion. The APA Dictionary of Psychology
defines mood as "a disposition to respond emotionally in a particular
way that may last for hours, days, or even weeks, perhaps at a low level
and without the person knowing what prompted the state." In other words,
the key differences between emotions and moods would be:

-   Emotions typically have short duration, whereas moods have long
    duration;

-   Emotions typically have moderate to high intensity, whereas moods
    have low intensity;

-   Emotions typically have obvious causes that are available to
    conscious introspection, whereas moods do not necessarily have
    obvious causes, at least from the perspective of the person who's
    having the mood.

#### Feeling

We can define 'feeling' as "the subjective experience of an emotion or
mood". In the context of emotions, the 'feeling' corresponds to the
experiential component of the three-part response pattern we described
earlier.

#### Affect

We can then define 'affect' as an umbrella term that encompasses
emotions, moods, and feelings. This is a useful term to use when we
don't want to commit to one of these finer categories.

#### Perceived versus felt affect

The distinction between *perceived* and *felt* affect is a recurring one
in the music emotion literature. We will discuss both terms now.

##### Perception and expression

When we say that someone 'perceives' an affect, we mean that they are
recognising a potential signal for that affect. This signal could be
embodied in all kinds of ways, for example in the prosody of a speech
utterance, or in the tonal structure of a melody. For example, most
Western listeners will perceive 'Old MacDonald' as being a happy melody.

The creative counterpart of perception is expression. When we say that
someone 'expresses' an affect, we mean that they are creating a signal
for the affect that could in theory be perceived by someone else.

##### Feeling and induction

When we say that someone 'feels' an affect, we mean that they actually
experience that affect. Feeling an affect is considered to be a stronger
process than simply perceiving an effect. For example, I might hear a
minor-mode melody and recognise that it is expressing sadness, but I may
not experience that sadness myself in any concrete way. Feeling an
affect might be just an experiential phenomenon, but it might also
include behavioural and physiological components.

The creative counterpart of feeling is induction. When we say that a
stimulus 'induces' an affect, we mean that the stimulus causes the
participant to feel that effect. Induction is a stronger process than
expression.

## Modelling emotion

In the previous section we ended up with the following definition of
emotion: "Emotion is a complex reaction pattern, involving experiential,
behavioural, and physiological elements, typically (but not exclusively)
elicited as a response to a personally significant matter or event."

It's possible to imagine an almost infinite number of ways in which an
individual can respond to a 'personally significant matter or event',
especially if we are including all three components of experience,
behaviour, and physiology. We need some kind of way to make sense of all
of these possible reaction patterns. This is the purpose of emotion
models: to organise this space of potential reactions in a meaningful
way.

We're going to cover a few different emotion models in this session.
They're not *computational* models, in the sense of Chapter
\@ref(computational-music-psychology) -- they're better described as
*theoretical* models. These models fall into two main categories:
*dimensional* models and *categorical* models.

### Dimensional models

Dimensional models express emotions as points in continuous space. The
location of a point in continuous space is fully specified by a series
of numbers, with one number corresponding to each dimension.

For example, consider this point in 2-dimensional space. It has the
coordinates (4, 2). This means it has a score of 4 on dimension 1, and a
score of 2 on dimension 2.

![](images/2-dimensions.png){width="300"}

These continuous spaces can have arbitrary numbers of dimensions. In
this next example we have three dimensions. Our point is located at
coordinates (4, 2, 3), corresponding to scores of 4, 2, and 3 on the
three dimensions respectively.

![](images/3-dimensions.png){width="300"}

The best-known dimensional model of emotions is the *circumplex* model,
introduced by Russell in 1980 [@russell1980]. This is a very simple
model, with just two dimensions. It works surprisingly well nonetheless.

The first dimension is the *arousal* dimension. Emotions can vary in a
continuous way between low arousal and high arousal.

Arousal is associated with subjective energy levels. When in a state of
high arousal, we feel awake, activated, and reactive to stimuli. This
subjective feeling is coupled with a variety of distinctive
physiological features, including increased heart rate, increased blood
pressure, increased perspiration (i.e. sweating), increased respiration
(i.e. breathing) rate, increased muscle tension, and increased metabolic
rate. Together, these different physiological features serve the
function of preparing the individual to perform some kind of physical or
mental task in the near future.

The second dimension is the *valence* dimension. Emotions can vary on a
continuous scale between very negative valence and very positive
valence. Positive valence corresponds to what we might call 'good'
feelings. Positive valence is a desirable state to be in. In contrast,
negative valence corresponds to bad feelings, and an undesirable state.
In an emotional context, the primary function of valence is presumably
to encourage the individual to take decisions that are good for the
organism's security, longevity, and reproductive success.

If we put these two dimensions together, we get the so-called circumplex
model of emotion:

![](images/circumplex.png){width="300"}

The idea then is that an individual's emotional state at a particular
point in time can be represented in terms of their locations on these
two dimensions of arousal and valence.

-   Imagine a footballer who just scored a goal, and is performing a
    victory celebration: we'd expect them to be experiencing **high
    arousal** and **positive valence**.

-   If I'm running to catch a train, I'm probably in a state of **high
    arousal** but **negative valence**. The arousal helps me to run
    faster, whereas the low valence discourages me from cutting it so
    fine next time.

-   If I'm bored at work, that's probably a state of **low arousal** and
    **negative valence**.

-   Lastly, if I'm cozy in bed, I'd expect both **low arousal** and
    **positive valence**.

While the circumplex model works fairly well with just two dimensions,
we can get further by adding more dimensions. One example is the
'Pleasure, Arousal, Dominance' model, which we can abbreviate to the
'PAD' model [@mehrabian1974approach]. Two of the PAD model's dimensions
correspond closely to dimensions of the circumplex model: the PAD
model's Pleasure-Displeasure dimension corresponds closely to the
circumplex model's valence dimension, and the PAD model's
Arousal-Nonarousal dimension corresponds to the circumplex model's
arousal dimension. The main difference is the new third dimension, the
Dominance-Submissiveness dimension.

This new Dominance-Submissiveness dimension helps us to distinguish
certain important emotions that were indistinguishable under the
circumplex model. Take anger and fear, for example: they are both
essentially equivalent under the circumplex model, because they both
corresponded to negative valence and high arousal. The new
Dominance-Submissiveness dimension distinguishes both these emotions:
anger corresponds to dominance, whereas fear corresponds to
submissiveness.

### Categorical models

As implied by the name, categorical models organise the space of all
possible emotions into a set of discrete categories, each with its own
special set of identifying characteristics.

The English language already provides many different words to describe
emotion-related concepts. If we wanted, we could treat each word as its
own emotional category, and this would make sense in a certain way:
words are rarely ever exact synonyms, and each one will provide its own
particular set of connotations and implications. However, this wouldn't
be all that useful for helping us to understand the psychological nature
of emotion: we'd have many, many different categories, and no good idea
of which ones are more important or fundamental than others.

One useful concept here is Ekman's concept of basic emotions
[@ekman1999]. Ekman's argument is that we should understand the
psychology of emotions in terms of a set of so-called 'basic emotions',
which are the building blocks for all of human emotional experience.

Ekman specified a strict set of requirements for something to count as a
basic emotion. These are specified in detail in @ekman1999:

-   First, it must have a set of distinctive *universal signals*; these
    signals function to communicate one's emotional state with
    conspecifics. According to Ekman, these signals should be shared
    cross-culturally.

-   Second, the emotion must have a distinctive *physiological
    signature*, encompassing variables such as heart rate and
    perspiration.

-   Third, the emotion must possess an automatic *appraisal mechanism*:
    in other words, the emotion must arise spontaneously as a reaction
    to a situation, rather than being the consequence of careful and
    considered thought.

Lastly, the emotion must possess universal *antecedent events*: that
means that the same kinds of events should elicit the same emotions
cross-culturally. For example, we might suppose that rotten food always
elicits disgust.

To take one example, these definitions rule out 'nostalgia' as a basic
emotion. Nostalgia does not have a clear set of distinctive universal
signals, or a clear set of associated physiological manifestations.

Ekman identified a core set of emotions that do fulfil these basic
criteria. These are: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, contempt, sadness,
and surprise. It's worth going through each of these and thinking about
how humans signal these emotions, how our behaviour is influenced by
these emotions, and how our body reacts physiologically to them.

Ekman also identified a collection of other emotions that might one day
be proved to be basic emotions. These candidates include things like
sensory pleasures, amusement, relief, and excitement.

So, to summarise Ekman's perspective: he's claiming that we should be
careful about what we call an 'emotion'. It's best to focus on 'core' or
'basic' emotions that are universal across the human species, and that
have distinctive manifestations in terms of subjective experience,
physiology, and signalling.

### Dimensional versus categorical models

Both dimensional and categorical approaches have their own advantages
and disadvantages. This makes different approaches useful in different
situations.

The dimensional models provide particularly efficient summaries of
relationships between emotions. This is very useful in helping us to
organise the great diversity of potential emotional experiences in an
understandable way. If we're lucky, the underlying dimensions for these
models can also have biological significance, in corresponding to
underlying physiological mechanisms. The arousal dimension of the
circumplex and PAD models is a good example of this, corresponding to a
collection of clearly identifiable physiological variables.

The main limitation of the dimensional models is their limited
expressivity. It is often quite easy to think of pairs of emotions that
have clearly distinct response patterns, but have similar
representations under a given dimensional model. So, in themselves,
dimensional models struggle to provide a complete account of human
emotion.

Categorical emotions address this problem quite well. They are
well-suited to capturing subtle differences between emotions: any time
you want to differentiate two emotions, you can just create a new
category.

However, this flexibility is also the weakness of this approach. It's
easy to create more and more categories to capture various nuances of
emotion, and eventually you end up with a long 'shopping list' of many
different emotion terms, with no clear structure behind it. In order to
understand how these terms fit together, you then have to start thinking
about a supplementary organisation scheme, for example organising them
into a hierarchical taxonomy, or overlaying them onto a dimensional
model and so on. So, the two approaches can work quite well together.

There is still an important underlying psychological question here, and
that is whether human emotions are fundamentally organised into
categories or not, or whether the space of possible emotions is
fundamentally continuous. This question is still being debated in the
literature, and there is still no clear answer. Unfortunately, the
conclusion seems to depend a lot on how you define emotion...

### Aesthetic and musical emotions

We're now going to move from Ekman's basic emotions model onto emotion
models that specifically concern aesthetic and musical emotions. These
models typically take a much more relaxed approach to deciding what
might constitute an emotion. In particular, many of the emotions being
described in this context don't have any well-established physiological
correlates or universal signals.

#### Geneva Musical Emotions Scale (GEMS)

The Geneva Emotional Music Scale (GEMS) was introduced by
@Zentner2008-mv. Compared to the 'basic emotions' model discussed
earlier, the GEMS has a much more inclusive definition of emotions.
Instead of working under strict definitions of what features are needed
to make something an emotion, the authors instead compiled a very broad
set of terms from the literature and from other sources, and used a
data-driven approach to work out which terms were most relevant for
musical applications.

The way this worked is that the authors conducted a series of
experiments based on self-report questionnaires, designed to probe how
people experience emotions in musical contexts. These experiments were
centred on two main questions. First, what emotions are most commonly
induced by musical experiences? Secondly, what emotions tend to co-occur
with each other in these musical experiences?

The output of this work was the following emotion model:

```

The model is hierarchical, in that it describes musical emotions in
terms of three nested layers. The top layer has just three categories:
sublimity, vitality, and unease. The second layer splits these
categories into subcategories: for example, unease is split into tension
and sadness, whereas vitality is split into power and joyful activation.
Each of these subcategories is then split into more granular terms: for
example, sadness is split into 'sad' and 'sorrowful'. This nested
structure gives us an idea about how different kinds of emotional
experiences tend to go together in music listening contexts.

One interesting thing to see from this model is a clear *positivity*
bias. The most commonly reported emotions are positive ones, such as
wonder, transcendence, and tenderness: negative emotions, such as
tension and sadness, play a comparatively small role.

The analysis approach of the GEMS identifies certain 'factors'
corresponding to emotion terms that often go together in musical
experiences. For example, the makeup of the 'Tension' term tells us that
the terms 'agitated', 'nervous', 'tense', 'impatient', and 'irritated'
tend to occur in conjunction when people talk about musical experiences.
This doesn't necessarily tell us though that there is an underlying
unitary emotion called 'tension', certainly not according to Ekman's
definition of basic emotions. However, this co-occurrence does suggest a
meaningful connection between these different emotional concepts in
terms of the musical features that elicit them. These connections could
be probed in more detail in experimental studies.

#### Cowan's 13-dimension model of musical feelings

@Cowen2020-jx present another data-driven approach to understanding musical
emotions. As @Zentner2008-mv did with the GEMS, 
@Cowen2020-jx begin by compiling a large number of emotional terms from the 
literature, and then use statistical techniques to distill these terms 
down to a smaller number of summary terms. 
One difference though is that @Cowen2020-jx have their listeners respond
to individual stimuli presented in real time, 
rather than just asking the listener about their lifetime experiences of music.
A second difference is that @Cowen2020-jx focus on *perceived* emotion 
rather than *experienced* emotion.
A third differences is that @Cowen2020-jx takes a cross-cultural perspective,
looking in particular for emotions that are perceived similarly by both
US listeners and for Chinese listeners.
A final difference is that @Cowen2020-jx looks to contrast categorical with 
dimensional theories of musical emotion.

Their first step was to compile a long list of 28 emotion categories
(or more broadly, 'feeling' categories) that might be evoked by music,
partly on reviews of previous music psychology research and partly based
on their own intuitions. Here is the full list:

-   Amusing
-   Angry
-   Annoying
-   Anxious, tense
-   Awe-inspiring, amazing
-   Beautiful
-   Bittersweet
-   Calm, relaxing, serene
-   Compassionate, sympathetic
-   Dreamy
-   Eerie, mysterious
-   Energizing, pump-up
-   Entrancing
-   Erotic, desirious
-   Euphoric, ecstatic
-   Exciting
-   Goose bumps
-   Indignant, defiant
-   Joyful, cheerful
-   Nauseating, revolting
-   Painful
-   Proud, strong
-   Romantic, loving
-   Sad, depressing
-   Scary, fearful
-   Tender, longing
-   Transcendent, mystical
-   Triumphant, heroic

Next they asked 111 US participants to contribute 5-second musical
extracts conveying each of these emotion categories.
This produced a collection of 1,841 extracts in total.

They then asked 1,011 US participants and 895 Chinese participants to
perform two tasks. One task was to match each extract to one of the 28
categories listed above. The other task was to rate the extracts on 11
features compiled from existing dimensional theories of emotion:

-   Arousal
-   Attention
-   Certainty
-   Commitment
-   Dominance
-   Enjoyment
-   Familiarity
-   Identity
-   Obstruction
-   Safety
-   Valence

They then correlated mean judgments on these 28 categories and 11 dimensions
between US and Chinese listeners. This tells us, for example, how much
do US listeners agree with Chinese listeners on which extracts are high
arousal and which are low arousal. This produced the following figure:

```{r}
embed_image(
  image = "images/cowen-2000/cowen-2000-fig-1a.png",
  width = "100%",
  title = "Correlations in affect ratings between US and Chinese listeners, from @Cowen2020-jx.",
  info = "The orange bars correspond to categories, the green bars to dimensions. The error bars represent standard errors. Correlations are disattenuated for measurement error.",
  # credit = "Licensed for noncommercial and educational use." 
)
```

Some judgments (e.g. 'triumphant'; 'compassionate') elicit very high correlations,
indicating that they are interpreted very consistently between US and Chinese
listeners. Some elicit relatively low correlations; in particular, 
'entrancing' has such a low correlation that one suspects there has been
some error when translating the term into Chinese.

It is interesting to see that the two best representatives of the dimensional tradition,
arousal and valence, 
achieve relatively low correlations across cultures,
and are outperformed by many representatives of the categorical tradition.
@Cowen2020-jx argue that this shows that arousal and valence aren't 
essential ingredients of musical emotions after all.
However, there are other possible explanations too.
For example, the low correlation for these measures might have happened
because it's relatively hard for listeners to reason about abstract concepts like
arousal and valence as compared to more concrete concepts like amusement.
The low correlation might also have happened because these more abstract concepts
are harder to translate accurately between English and Chinese.

Having dismissed the dimensional evaluation measures, the authors then 
ask whether the 28 categories can be simplified down to a smaller number of 
measures. They do this using a 'dimension-reduction' technique called 
'preserved principal component analysis' (PPCA). PPCA is a special version 
of a more common technique called principal component analysis (PPA).
These techniques take a large number of variables (in this case, the 28 category ratings)
and try to simplify them into a smaller number of variables that summarise
the important trends in the full variable set. These summary variables are
defined as 'linear combinations' of the original variables:
for example, a summary variable might be created by 
taking input variable 1 multiplied by 1.2,
adding to it input variable 2 multiplied by 2.3,
adding to it variable 3 multiplied by -0.2, and so on.

The main principle in PCA is that you want to find summary variables that 
don't throw away too much information about the original variables.
PPCA does something slightly different here.
It finds summary variables that are designed to correlate as well as possible
between US and Chinese listeners.
In other words, we are looking for concepts that yield consistent ratings
across the two different cultures.

The authors find evidence in their analyses for 13 underlying dimensions, 
a reduction of more than 50% from the original 28,
but still many more than the two or three dimensions ordinarily posited
by traditional dimensional accounts of musical emotion.^[
That said, if we look at the figure below, we can see that only the first
8 dimensions really achieve a substantial correlation between US and China
ratings; past this the correlations hover around .1, which is an almost
negligible relationship.
8 dimensions is still many more than 2, though!

)
```

The authors then ask what these 13 dimensions represent.
Having performed a postprocessing technique called 'varimax rotation'
to simplify the results, they get the following list:

- Amusing
- Annoying
- Anxious/tense
- Beautiful
- Calm/relaxing/serene
- Dreamy
- Energizing/pump-up
- Erotic/desirous
- Indigant/defiant
- Joyful/cheerful
- Sad/depressing
- Scary/fearful
- Triumphant/heroic

Each excerpt in their library receives scores along each of these dimensions.
Examining these scores, the authors make several interesting observations.
One is that there are no discrete clusters in the dataset:
instead, there is a continuum of emotional expression between these different
concepts. The second is that individual excerpts often blend several
of these dimensions together: for example, it is possible to be both 
amusing and joyful. However, some do not go together: for example, 
no excerpts were labelled both sad and energizing.

It is difficult to visualise all of these 13 dimensions at the same time.
However, it is possible to put the music excerpts onto a two-dimensional map
where similarly rated excerpts sit near to each other. The authors have created
such a map which you can explore yourself here 
([external link](https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/%7Eacowen/music.html)).
To move around the map, use two fingers on your trackpad (on a laptop)
or use the scroll wheel (on a mouse):

The authors also provide a similar map produced in a second experiment that 
additionally tested traditional Chinese music. This is also interesting to 
explore

```

So, to summarise, this paper implies that we can identify many different 
emotions (or emotional feelings) in music, considerably more than can be captured
by simple dimensional models such as the circumplex model. Traditional emotion
dimensions such as arousal and valence seemed not to be a particularly useful
way of summarising emotional responses; instead the clearest results came
from specific emotions such as amusing, annoying, and anxious/tense.
These emotions are evaluated fairly consistently between US and Chinese 
listeners.

When interpreting the results from this paper, it's worth bearing in mind
that the dimensions were optimised for maximising the correlation US and 
Chinese listeners. This can be motivated by the argument that the most 
fundamental emotional mechanisms should be those that are present cross-culturally.
However, such an approach will neglect emotions that are expressed in
culturally specific ways. Is this really the way forward? Surely these 
kinds of culturally specific expressions can be very interesting in their own right?

#### Aesthetic emotions

A third way of looking at musical emotions comes from @menninghaus2019.
@menninghaus2019 speak of a particular class of emotions called 
*aesthetic emotions*, which concern the perception of beauty,
not only in music, but also in artworks, landscapes, architecture,
and so on.

@menninghaus2019 argue that aesthetic emotions fall into two main classes:

The first class corresponds to aesthetic versions of 'ordinary'
emotions. These emotions correspond to an 'ordinary' emotion, such as
joy, amusement, or nostalgia, or surprise, that an aesthetic object can
induce in us.

The second category contains emotions that concern the appreciation of
aesthetic virtues. This category might include emotions such as 'the
feeling of beauty', 'the feeling of sublime', 'the feeling of groove',
and so on.

The authors make various important observations about aesthetic
emotions:

-   **Aesthetic emotions are deeply linked with pleasure and
    displeasure**. They therefore make an important contribution to the
    overall attractiveness of an aesthetic experience.

-   **Pleasure is largely determined by the intensity of the aesthetic
    emotion**. So, we can experience pleasure on account of an intense
    feeling of joy, of amusement, of beauty, of sublimity, and so on.

-   **An intense experience can be pleasant**, even for an aesthetic
    emotion that corresponds to a 'negative' ordinary emotion. For
    example, if music evokes a strong feeling of sadness, this will
    generally still correspond to a pleasant aesthetic experience.

The authors also note that aesthetic emotions possess important and
necessary characteristics of 'ordinary' emotions. They are associated
with clear physiological variables, such as heart rate, perspiration,
and chills; they are associated with clear signals, such as laughter,
tears, and smiling; they're also associated with clear behavioural
outcomes, such as a tendency to end, extend or repeat exposure to the
aesthetic object. That said, it's important to note that these features
are not necessarily 'distinctive' in the way required by Ekman's
definitions of basic emotions; most of the time, they seem to co-opt
response patterns from pre-existing basic emotions, such as happiness
and sadness.

This leads us onto an important open question in the literature: do we
really need to posit aesthetic emotions as a separate category of
emotion? There is an interesting series of response articles in the
literature debating this point. The skeptic's position
[e.g. @skov2020] is that aesthetic emotions are best understood in terms of
'ordinary' emotions. These emotions might be experienced in a special
combination, perhaps even a combination that is difficult to achieve in
normal life (e.g. anger and happiness). They might also be experienced
in an unusual presentation: for example, experiencing sadness in an
aesthetic context might remove its behavioural components (which
typically make sadness an unpleasant experience) while leaving other
components of physiology, signalling, and subjective experience
unaffected. This is all still a topic of debate, and there's no clear
resolution in sight!

### Conclusions

Emotion is something of a paradoxical topic to study psychologically. On
the one hand, as humans we are all intuitively aware of what it means to
experience emotions, in a way that arguably can never be expressed fully
in words. This can make a lot of this topic feel trivial, in a certain
way. On the other hand, when we dig deeper, we realise that there are
some very deep issues here that deserve careful examination.

The models we talked about here can help us to structure these investigations
by giving us a vocabulary with which to talk about emotions as well as
a theoretical account of how these emotions relate to each other.
We have talked in particular about three different models of musical emotions:
the GEMS musical emotions model [@Zentner2008-mv],
the 13-dimension model of @Cowen2020-jx,
and the aesthetic emotions model of @menninghaus2019.
Together they illustrate how musical emotions seem to be very rich 
and hard to summarise with simple models such as the traditional 
circumplex (arousal-valence) model.
This complexity is exciting from an artistic perspective, but challenging
from a scientific one; it's unclear that any of these models is really enough
to capture all the nuances of musical experiences. Nonetheless, we have to start
somewhere...

## Measuring emotional responses

This section introduces various ways that we can measure emotional
responses in the context of psychological experiments. Broadly speaking,
we can organise these measurement techniques into three primary
categories: self-report measures, physiological measures, and neural
measures.

### Self-report

The idea behind self-report measures is simply to ask the participant
about their emotional experiences. This relies on the fact that, at
least in Western society, most adult participants have fairly
sophisticated vocabularies for describing their emotional experiences.

There are many ways in which we could ask someone about their emotional
experiences, in more or less structured ways. A particularly common
approach though is to use rating scales; here we simply ask people to
describe an emotional experience by rating it according to various
criteria, for example 'joyfulness' or 'anger'. These numbers can then be
aggregated to provide a quantitative summary of the participant's
emotional responses.

There are various kinds of rating scales we could use here. One
prominent option is the Geneva Emotional Music Scale, or 'GEMS' (Zentner
et al., 2008), which we discussed in Section \@ref(modelling-emotion).
We could equivalently use the 13-dimension model derived by 
@Cowen2020-jx (see above).

The GEMS takes many different emotion terms (on the left hand side
here), and clusters them together into a three-level hierarchy. The
scale was constructed in a data-driven way: the emotion terms are terms
that frequently occur when people describe music-induced emotional
experiences, and the higher-level clusters (or 'factors') describe how
these different emotion terms tend to co-occur with each other.

We can use the GEMS to make questionnaires for quantifying certain kinds
of core emotional responses to music. For example, suppose I want to
quantify the tension that someone experiences when they listen to a
particular piece of music. The GEMS tells me that a good way to do that
is to give the participant rating scales for five adjectives: agitated,
nervous, tense, impatient, and irritated. I get the participant to rate
their experience on these five adjectives. I then combine their results,
for example by averaging, and this gives me an overall 'tension' score.
Similarly, the GEMS tells me that I could compute scores for a general
'unease' factor by first computing scores for 'tension' and 'sadness',
and then combining them.

![The 'Unease' component of the GEMS, redrawn after
@Zentner2008-mv.](images/gems-subset.png){width="600"}

This kind of approach has several advantages. It's easy to get data for
very specific adjectives: if I'm interested in nostalgia, I can simply
ask the participant 'to what extent does this music make you feel
nostalgic'? The approach is also rather efficient -- it only takes a
moment for the participant to record what emotion they feel. There's
also no need for expensive laboratory equipment, all you need is pen and
paper.

However, there are some important disadvantages. The results are
mediated by the participant's vocabulary, and this is problematic for
working with people with limited vocabularies, as well as for
generalising the paradigm across different languages or cultures.
There's also a problem that participants can easily get confused between
the two concepts of 'expressed' and 'induced' emotion. In a particular
study, we might be specifically interested in what kinds of emotions the
music makes the participant *feel*, but if we ask the participant to
describe what emotions the music makes them feel, it's quite common for
the participant to mistakenly describe what emotions the music seems to
be expressing.

### Physiological

#### Heart rate

An obvious thing to measure is the heart rate; this can be achieved with
inexpensive and unobtrusive heart rate monitors. Many smart watches
nowadays even include heart rate monitors as standard. Two aspects of
heart rate are typically monitored: the absolute value and the
variability. The arousal component of emotion is typically associated
both with high absolute values and high variability in values,
reflecting the body's preparation for imminent physical exertion.

#### Respiration rate

The respiration rate corresponds to the number of breaths that the
participant takes per minute. One way of measuring this is with a
'pneumograph', as displayed here: a pneumograph measures respiration by
tracking chest movements. High respiration rates are associated with
high arousal.

#### Goosebump recorder

Intense emotional experiences, especially in the context of music, are
often accompanied by skin tingling and goosebumps, corresponding to a
process called 'piloerection' where body hairs stand on end. These
experiences are called 'chills'. It's possible to record the development
of goosebumps using custom cameras placed for example on the
participant's arm.

#### Skin conductance response

Increased arousal is associated with increased perspiration, or
sweating. It's possible to quantify this perspiration effect by
measuring the so-called 'skin conductance response'. Here we place two
electrodes on the skin, and pass a small current between them. The ease
with which this current travels depends on the skin's conductance, and
this conductance depends on perspiration levels: increased levels of
perspiration correspond to greater levels of conductance.

#### Skin temperature

Skin temperature provides another proxy for arousal. We can measure skin
temperature with an infrared camera, for example. Increased arousal
tends to be reflected in a drop in nasal skin temperature, as a result
of restricted blood flow in peripheral regions.

thermography as a measure of emotion response. Emotion Review, 7(2),
157-162.](images/skin-temperature.png){width="350"}

#### Facial electromyography

Facial electromyography is based on the observation that certain
emotions tend to elicit certain universal facial expressions, for
example smiling or frowning. Often the participant will not smile or
frown in a significant enough way for this smile or frown to be detected
by an external observer; however, if we measure muscle activity in
certain facial muscles, we may still be able to detect some signs of
stimulation. This is what facial electromyography is for: we place
electrodes next to certain muscles in the face, and record electrical
activity at the locations of these muscles. For example, we can place
electrodes on the zygomaticus major muscle, and this can give us a proxy
of smiling. We can also place electrodes on the corrugator supercilii
muscle, which is associated with frowning.

Unfortunately, this can be quite an invasive procedure for the
participant, with their face ending up being covered in electrodes. In
practice, it can be preferable to use a less invasive method of facial
monitoring instead, such as a video camera, sacrificing some sensitivity
for the sake of a more naturalistic listening experience.

#### Pupillometry

Pupillometry can also provide an insight into a participant's emotional
responses. Normally, the pupil dilates (i.e. expands) and contracts
depending on light levels, but pupil dilation also occurs in the context
of arousal and surprise. We can record these dilation responses by
focusing a camera on the participant's eye and recording their pupil
size over time.

#### Conclusions

These physiological measures have certain important advantages. One
advantage is we avoid having our results mediated through vocabulary;
this means that we can easily apply the same methods to many different
populations, including cross-cultural populations or linguistically
impaired populations. A second advantage is that these measures are by
definition necessary if we want to understand the full response pattern
underlying a particular emotion. As we discussed before, the definition
of an emotion typically includes a physiological component, and we must
characterise this physiological component properly if we want to
understand the emotion.

Unfortunately, physiological measures come with their own disadvantages.
They tend to produces rather noisy data streams, which means in practice
that we need more participants or longer testing sessions in order to
reach sufficient reliability levels. It's also rather difficult to
distinguish emotions in fine detail using these methods. If we want to
distinguish emotions that vary solely on arousal, these methods can work
pretty well, but other kinds of distinctions are harder to make. Lastly,
the methods can be invasive to a certain degree. Anything that involves
placing a physical device on the participant will introduce some
distraction and potentially alter the nature of the listening
experience.

### Neuroimaging

The purpose of neural measures is to get some insight into the brain
processing underlying a particular emotional response.

There are many different neural measures out there, but here we will
focus in particular on *functional* *magnetic resonance imaging*, or
fMRI. This method is particularly attractive for emotion studies
because, unlike several other methods, it is well-suited to accessing
the deeper brain regions that tend to be associated with emotion
processing. The method is also particularly good at providing precise
spatial localisation of activity within the brain, which is helpful for
differentiating the precise processes that are going on.

fMRI assesses blood oxygen levels in different regions of the brain,
which provide a relatively real-time marker of ongoing neural activity.
By looking at the locations of this neural activity, we can hypothesise
about what brain areas are involved in a particular cognitive process.

Through this process, neuroscientists have identified various regions of
the brain involved in various aspects of emotional responses to music.
One such region is the *amygdala* -- this is implicated in both pleasant
and unpleasant emotions, particularly fear, anxiety, and aggression.
It's thought to be involved in coding music's affective positivity or
negativity.

public domain, via Wikimedia Commons](images/amygdala.jpg){width="450"}

The *nucleus accumbens,* which is part of the ventral striatum, seems to
be another important region in explaining emotional responses to music.
In general psychological contexts, the nucleus accumbens has been
implicated in motivation, aversion, and reward. In the context of music,
the nucleus accumbens seems to be particularly involved in the
generation of pleasure.

Lastly, there's the *hippocampus*. The hippocampus seems to have many
different functions, but in the context of general emotion research it
has been linked to tender positive emotions and behaviours such as joy,
love, compassion, empathy, grooming, and nursing offspring. This seems
to translate over to music emotion studies, which have found the
hippocampus to be involved in various music-evoked emotions including
tenderness, peacefulness, joy, and sadness.

public domain, via Wikimedia
Commons](images/hippocampus.jpg){width="400"}

These kinds of neural measures have a very important advantage over the
other methods, which is that they can identify specific brain regions
involved in particular experimental contexts.

They do however have some important disadvantages. One is that they
involve expensive equipment -- an fMRI machine will cost many hundreds
of thousands of pounds, and is expensive to maintain. fMRI machines in
particular tend to be rather noisy, which can be problematic in music
experiments for obvious reasons. The final issue is perhaps the deepest,
and concerns the interpretation of the results. Any particular brain
region will typically have multiple functions, and so decoding patterns
of brain activations is a very complex task. It's not possible right now
to look at an fMRI scan and say 'aha, this person is experiencing
nostalgia...'.

### Conclusions

Here we covered three different approaches to measuring emotions that
could be applied in music studies: self-report measures, physiological
measures, and neural measures. These methods all bring their own
strengths and weaknesses, and we arguably need all of them if we want to
fully characterise an emotional response. In practice though, we're
limited by the available resources. Self-report measures end up being
particularly popular as a result!

## Mechanisms for inducing musical emotion

This section is about different mechanisms by which music seems to
induce emotions. We're going to focus on a particularly influential
theoretical model by Juslin, called the **'BRECVEM'** model. This model
is described in a 2008 paper in Behavioral and Brain Sciences by
@juslin2008. This is a really good paper to read if you have the time.
As well as providing a detailed and well-organised exposition of the
model, the paper also includes a large number of commentaries by various
other researchers in the field. This gives you an insight into various
complementary perspectives on the topic, and can really help you to
develop your own personal opinion about the ideas.

A few years later, Juslin wrote a paper that extends the BRECVEM model
to add an additional component, concerning aesthetic judgments
[@juslin2013]. The result is then called the BRECVEMA model. It's this
particular version of the model that we'll focus on today. I'd still
recommend keeping the original BRECVEM paper as a primary reference
though, because it contains particularly detailed expositions of the
first seven components of the model.

There are eight components of the full BRECVEMA model: brain stem
reflex, rhythmic entrainment, evaluative conditioning, emotional
contagion, visual imagery, episodic memory, musical expectancy, and
aesthetic judgment. Let's consider each in turn.

### Brain stem reflex

The *brain stem* is one of the oldest parts of the brain, evolutionarily
speaking. It has important responsibilities in regulating cardiac and
respiratory function. The brain stem reflex is a hardwired attention
response that reflects early stages of auditory processing; it's
triggered by sounds that are 'surprising' in terms of basic auditory
features. Most commonly this means a sudden and loud sound, especially
if this sound feels 'sharp' or 'accelerating'. It's important to respond
quickly to these kinds of sounds because they can reflect some kind of
immediate threat. Depending on the context, the brain stem reflex can be
experienced either as unpleasant or exciting, and is correspondingly
linked to arousal.

### Rhythmic entrainment

Rhythmic entrainment is something of an umbrella term that captures many
different modes of entrainment, or synchronisation. It could mean
perceptual entrainment, the kind that happens naturally and
automatically simply by listening to rhythmic music. It could mean motor
entrainment, where you might tap along or dance to the beat. It could be
physiological entrainment, where your breathing might synchronise with
the music. It could be social entrainment, where you synchronise your
movements with several others in your group, perhaps by dancing.

These processes of entrainment can have various implications. Rhythmic
entrainment often ends up increasing arousal levels and causing
pleasure. Entrainment also seems to evoke feelings of connectedness and
emotional bonding; this is particularly true when the entrainment occurs
in a group context, and involves multiple individuals synchronising with
each other.

### Evaluative conditioning

Evaluative conditioning describes an effect whereby repeatedly pairing a
piece of music with a given emotion ends up causing a listener to
automatically associate that music with the emotion in the future.
Importantly, this association doesn't require conscious awareness: the
music can make you happy as a result of the association, but you don't
know why you're happy. An example could be listening to a particular
piece of music that you always used to play when you met your best
friend.

### Emotional contagion

Emotional contagion depends on the fact that listeners will
automatically recognise certain features in the music that are similar
to markers of emotion in speech [e.g. @juslin2003a]. For example, if I'm
feeling miserable, my speech is likely to be slower, with lower pitch
variability, and drooping contour; if I'm feeling excited, my speech is
likely to be faster, with higher pitch variability, and potentially a
rising contour.

@juslin2001a describes an interesting idea, termed 'super-expressive
voice theory', stating that music's power of emotional contagion comes
not just from the fact that music emulates the expressive capacities of
the human voice, but from the fact that it far exceeds them, in terms of
the potential manipulations of speed, intensity, and timbre. So, music
is accessing the parts of the brain originally intended for interpreting
speech expression, and sending them into overdrive.

### Visual imagery

This part of the model is based on the notion that music can (in certain
listeners) conjure up certain visual images, such as beautiful
landscapes. This effect depends on metaphorical, cross-modal
associations, for example between ascending melodies and upward
movement, or between rich textures and rich colours. The listener can
then experience emotions that are a consequence of these visual images.

### Episodic memory

This effect is sometimes termed the "Darling, they are playing our tune"
effect. It occurs when a listener has paired a particular musical piece
with a particular personally significant memory, perhaps a particular
event like a wedding or a Christmas party. Unlike the evaluative
conditioning mechanism we discussed earlier, episodic memory by
definition involves conscious recollection of the associated event.
Historically speaking, music theorists haven't seen episodic memory as
being particularly musically relevant, but survey data indicates that
episodic memory is a very frequent source of music emotion induction in
practice.

It's been noted for a while now that episodic memories (i.e. memories
for particular events from one's life) tend to be particularly strong
for events in youth and early adulthood, between about 15 and 25 years
of age. A potential reason for this is simply that many self-defining
experiences occur at this age, for example moving away from home, going
to university, and gaining financial independence.

This effect seems to be reflected in a musical 'reminiscence bump',
where music that we originally listening to in youth and early adulthood
acquires special retrospective significance. Music from this period
tends to be better recognised by the listener, more likely to evoke
autobiographical memories, and more likely to evoke emotions.

### Musical expectancy

We talked about musical expectancy (or expectation) already in a
previous section. Music listening generates real-time expectations in
the listener; these expectations can then be violated, delayed, or
confirmed. Simple violations of expectation, such as unexpected loud
chords, may be processed by the brain-stem reflex; more sophisticated
and style-dependent violations will depend on the listener's
enculturated knowledge about musical styles, as represented in
higher-level brain regions. These manipulations of expectation are
associated with emotional phenomena such as anxiety, surprise, thrills,
and pleasure.

### Aesthetic judgment

This part of the model is probably the most controversial; it's still
not totally agreed that aesthetic judgment requires a separate emotion
induction mechanism. This relates to the disputed topic of 'aesthetic
emotions' that we discussed in a previous section: some researchers
believe aesthetic emotions exist, but other researchers believe that
so-called 'ordinary' emotions are all that we need to explain emotional
reactions to art.

Below is a schematic diagram from Juslin's (2013) paper describing his
conceptualisation of the aesthetic judgment process. The listener
evaluates the music on several aesthetic criteria, listed here under the
headings of beauty, skill, novelty, style, message, expression, and
emotion. These different headings are unpacked in more detail in the
paper. From these features, the listener makes an overall aesthetic
judgment of the piece, which can be positive or negative. Different
listeners may weight these different features differently; for example,
listeners to avant-garde music might value novelty relatively strongly,
but value beauty less. An emotional response then develops on the basis
of this overall aesthetic judgment: strongly positive aesthetic
judgements elicit positive emotions, whereas strongly negative judgments
elicit negative emotions.

![Figure based on
@juslin2013.](images/juslin-aesthetic-emotions.png){width="100%"}

Personally, I think this final component of Juslin's model is rather
speculative, and I'm not completely convinced by it yet. I think it
provides a good basis for future exploration, though.

## Conclusions

We've now covered all the aspects of the BRECVEMA model of emotion
induction. It's clear that there are many potential mechanisms by which
music can induce emotions. This diversity of mechanisms is an important
reason why music has such strong emotional effects on listeners -- it
can activate these emotions in so many different ways.
