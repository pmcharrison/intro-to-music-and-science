<p>No study is perfect. There are many ways in which a given study can fail
to deliver the final word in a given research topic, ranging from
methodology to analysis to interpretation.
It’s essential to be able to appraise a study’s limitations when reading the
literature, because it helps one to know how confident to be in the study’s
findings.
It’s also essential to be able to appraise the potential limitations of a
during the planning stages; this helps us to make better decisions about
experiment design, and it helps us to develop realistic expectations of what
the study will deliver once it is conducted.</p>
<div id="learning-about-limitations" class="section level3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">26.1.1</span> Learning about limitations<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#learning-about-limitations"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>You can learn a certain amount about a published study’s limitations by reading the
paper’s ‘Discussion’ section. It is good practice for Discussion sections
to include a substantive discussion of the study’s potential limitations.
Of course, the original authors will typically have some incentive to present
their paper in a good light, so they may not be comprehensive in their
self-criticisms, but nonetheless this is a good place to start.</p>
<p>Review articles, and to a certain degree textbook chapters, are another good
place to look for insight into a study’s limitations. Such articles will
have a broader view of the field and will typically provide some kind of
comparative perspective on the different methodologies available to that field.
However, not all such articles have the space to really dive into the details
of individual articles.</p>
<p>The best resource for understanding a study’s limitations comes when you can
find a published commentary on that study. Only a minority of papers end up
receiving published commentaries, but when they do exist they can be very
useful. These commentaries tend to be published by different authors from the
original study, and tend to manifest alternative viewpoints to the original
authors. Some journals (e.g. ‘Behavioral and Brain Sciences’ and
‘Empirical Musicology Review’) actively solicit commentaries and publish them
alongside the original published article. Some journals (e.g. eLife, PeerJ)
publish original peer reviews alongside published articles, serving a similar
purpose.</p>
<p>Another great way to develop an appreciation of studies’ limitations is to
attend research presentations and journal clubs. When authors present work
at scientific conferences or at university seminars, they typically have a
Q&amp;A session afterwards where the attendees will typically debate the
implications and limitations of the presented work. This is a good opportunity
to see how the research community responds to a given work. Of course, such
Q&amp;A sessions are typically constrained by politeness, and audience members
may not feel comfortable in voicing their full criticisms. Journal clubs
are a nicely complementary venue; in a journal club the members discuss a
given paper in the absence of the original author, giving them freedom to
deliver honest verdicts without worrying too much about being polite.
Have a look for such sessions in your own university: for example, the
Centre for Music and Science at Cambridge runs a regular public seminar series
(<a href="https://cms.mus.cam.ac.uk/cms-seminars" class="uri">https://cms.mus.cam.ac.uk/cms-seminars</a>)
as well as an internal journal club.</p>

<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">26.2.1</span> Methodological mistake<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#methodological-mistake"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Methodological mistakes are, in many people’s eyes, the most serious kind
of study limitation. Many kinds of methodological mistakes are possible,
both before, during, and after the data collection itself. The best way to avoid
them is to be very careful in the design and conduct of your study, making sure
you familiarise yourself properly with the methods are using and making sure
you properly follow any available instructions.</p>
<p>One kind of methodological mistake corresponds to selecting the wrong
experimental measure. For example, suppose the experimenter wants to measure pain before
and after a 10-minute experimental intervention, but uses a pain questionnaire
that is grounded in questions about events that happened in the preceding 7
days. Such a questionnaire clearly cannot detect a meaningful change in pain
levels over a 10-minute interval; another questionnaire should be used that
focuses on present pain levels.</p>
<p>Another kind of methodological mistake corresponds to implementing the
experimental measure wrongly. Suppose the experimenter administers a personality
questionnaire where scores are derived by tallying responses to multiple
questions, but forgets to reverse score the items that are meant to be
reverse scored. This will introduce a lot of noise into the study’s results
and likely make the personality measure ineffective.</p>
<p>Another kind of methodological mistake corresponds to analysing the data wrongly.
Data analysis is hard, and as the data analysis technique becomes more complex
there are more potential pitfalls. One classic mistake is to neglect dependencies
within a given dataset, for example by treating each data point within a time series
as statistically independent (e.g. by putting these raw data points into a
t-test or an ANOVA) and not telling the analysis method that these data points
come from the same experimental trial and hence are likely to be correlated.
A related mistake is to collect many trials from the same participant and
put them straight into the statistical model without telling the model that
these trials come from the same participant. Another common statistical mistake is
to over-interpret a ‘statistically significant’ result that is driven by a single
‘outlier’ data point.</p>
<p>It can be quite hard to find methodological mistakes in published papers.
Peer review is meant to capture methodological mistakes where possible, and
so hopefully most published papers are free from such errors.
Of course, peer review can never be 100% reliable, and sometimes errors do
sneak through.</p>
</div>
<div id="interpretation-mistake" class="section level3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">26.2.2</span> Interpretation mistake<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#interpretation-mistake"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>A related issue is to misinterpret the outcomes of a study’s analyses.
It is possible to perform all your data collection rigorously,
and do all the appropriate statistical tests, but then interpret the results
of these tests wrongly.</p>
<p>The most classic interpretation mistake we see in the literature,
and indeed in popular news coverage of research articles,
is to mistake correlation for causation.
To say two variables are correlated is to say that high values of one
tend to go hand in hand with high values of the other;
for example, studies have shown that consumption of Mediterranean foods
is correlated with life expectancy.
It’s tempting to take such a correlation as proof that consuming Mediterranean
foods <em>causes</em> longer life expectancy.
However, observing such a correlation does not prove causality.
It could be that there is a third variable that causes both outcomes;
perhaps living in the Mediterranean causes people to experience other improved
lifestyle factors (e.g. more sunlight, more outdoor activity) that are
responsible for the increased lifespan.
In order to ‘prove’ causality here, one would have to dig deeper, most commonly
by conducting a randomised controlled trial.</p>
</div>
<div id="low-generality" class="section level3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">26.2.3</span> Low generality<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#low-generality"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>The statistics that we conduct when we analyse quantitative data give us some
kind of probabilistic guarantee about the population of participants and
(depending on the analysis) the population of stimuli
that we used in our experiment: in particular,
they tell us that we can have a certain degree of confidence that our
experimental results should replicate if we were to repeat the experiment
using new participants and new stimuli
<em>sampled from the same population as the original participants and stimuli</em>.
However, they can’t tell us how representative those populations of
participants and stimuli are of the ‘real world’ that we care about.
For example, perhaps we only tested undergraduate music students from our
home university, or perhaps we only tested a collection of Mozart sonatas.
We must think carefully about how much we can generalise from research findings
from these populations.</p>
</div>
<div id="low-statistical-power" class="section level3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">26.2.4</span> Low statistical power<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#low-statistical-power"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>The term ‘statistical power’ refers to the capacity of a research design
to produce statistically precise results. It typically relates directly
to the number of participants and the number of stimuli used in a study.
If we only test a few participants, and we observe an effect in a given
direction, it can be hard to tell whether that effect really means something
or whether it just reflects random variation between participants.
Likewise, if we only test a small number of stimuli it can be difficult to
distinguish our effects from random variation between stimuli.</p>
<p>Once we’ve collected a real dataset we can use standard statistical analysis
techniques to work out how precise our statistical inferences can be.
In particular, you will see researchers using concepts such as confidence
intervals and <em>p</em>-values to clarify the reliability of their findings.</p>
<p>If we’re still in the stage of planning the research, we can’t compute
confidence intervals and <em>p</em>-values directly. The most rigorous way to
estimate our statistical power <em>a priori</em> is instead to perform a
<em>power analysis</em>. You can find power analysis calculators online for a variety
of experimental designs; a common choice is
<a href="https://www.psychologie.hhu.de/arbeitsgruppen/allgemeine-psychologie-und-arbeitspsychologie/gpower">G*Power</a>.
The power analysis will typically be framed in terms of calculating the number
of participants required to identify an effect of a given size with a given
reliability, but it’s also possible to conduct power analyses that operate
in terms of the desired confidence interval size.
This approach is quite technical, but another useful approach is simply to
read prior papers in the area and see what the standard expectation is
for sample size. In practice, of course, the desire for greater statistical
power must be balanced with the feasibility of collecting extra data,
and in some cases the data are so hard to collect that the sample sizes
must be quite small.</p>
</div>
<div id="low-validity" class="section level3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">26.2.5</span> Low validity<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#low-validity"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Most psychological experiments involve some kinds of ‘measures’. These measures
are used to operationalise certain psychological constructs: for example,
we might use an IQ test to operationalise general intelligence, or the
Ten Item Personality Inventory to operationalise personality. It is always
worth considering how ‘valid’ these operationalisations are: how well does
the measure capture the concept that we are trying to measure? It might be that
a measure is valid in some contexts but not others; for example some personality
inventories work in terms of describing events from day-to-day life such as
attending parties, but if you come from a culture where the lifestyle is very
different then the questionnaire might not be a valid way to capture your
personality.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">26.3</span> Appraising and acknowledging limitations<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#appraising-and-acknowledging-limitations"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>All studies have their limitations. Limitations rarely have to sink a given
research project; there is almost always something that can be learned from
the data. It’s essential however to give an honest appraisal and acknowledgement
of these limitations when you write up your research. This applies both at the
planning stage (i.e. research proposals) and at the write-up stage
(i.e. research articles). A good, clear statement of limitations will help
the readers understand what they can and cannot read into your research,
and it’ll help researchers understand how they can build on it in future work.</p>
