Tones within certain physical distance cause overlapping excitation patterns, producing interference effects masking beating.low frequencies, given physical distance basilar membrane correspond relatively small frequency difference. example, 200 Hz, 1 mm movement corresponds frequency change approximately 50 Hz; contrast, 10,000 Hz, 1 mm movement corresponds frequency change approximately 700 Hz.Since critical bandwidth depends physical distance, since physical distance corresponds higher frequency distances higher frequencies, find critical bandwidth also increases higher frequencies. Hutchinson & Knopoff (1978) model relationship using following mathematical expression:critical bandwidth frequency expressed Hz. relationship looks like following:\nFigure 24.2: Critical bandwidth function frequency.\ninteresting express relationship using pitch notation instead frequency notation. , get following curve:\nFigure 24.3: Critical bandwidth function pitch.\nrelationship appears inverted: see now , pitch height increases, critical band corresponds narrower pitch intervals (measured semitones). ? Well, measuring critical bandwidth terms absolute frequency differences (measured Hz), whereas now measuring critical bandwidth terms pitch intervals, correspond frequency ratios. absolute frequency distance indeed increase base frequency increases, doesn’t decrease fast base frequency. means frequency ratio increases, hence pitch interval increases.phenomenon interesting consequence dissonance perception. implies particular pitch interval may sound dissonant played lower register, account tones localised critical band, may become consonant played higher register, critical bandwidth decreases causing tones localised separate critical bands. phenomenon seems provide good explanation voice spacing patterns common-practice Western tonal music (Harrison & Pearce, 2020; Huron & Sellmer, 1992).Let us return task modelling dissonance induced partials 4 5. begin estimating local critical bandwidth two partials. taking average two frequencies feeding Equation (24.1) (Figure 24.2). example, frequencies 532.2 Hz 659.2 Hz, mean frequency 591.2 Hz. , estimated critical bandwidth \\[\n1.72 \\times 591.2 ^ {0.65} = 108.9 \\mathrm{\\ Hz}.\n\\]Note instead using mathematical equation, alternatively found number graphically, taking zoomed-version Figure 24.2, drawing vertical line upwards 591.2 Hz horizontal axis, finding intersection plot line, drawing horizontal line vertical axis:\nFigure 24.4: Calculating critical bandwidth pitch.\nexpress distance two partials units critical bandwidth. achieve simply dividing distance Hz critical bandwidth. gives us:\\[\n\\frac{659.2 - 532.2}{108.9} = 1.17\n\\]plug number (1.17) idealised dissonance curve characterises dissonance varies function critical bandwidth distance pair pure tones.

First, compute product amplitudes two partials currently consideration. Since partials amplitudes 0.5, get:\\[\n0.5 \\times 0.5 = 0.25.\n\\]Second, compute sum squared amplitudes partials spectrum.
