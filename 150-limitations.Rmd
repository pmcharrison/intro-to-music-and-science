## Introduction

No study is perfect. There are many ways in which a given study can fail
to deliver the final word in a given research topic, ranging from 
methodology to analysis to interpretation. 
It's essential to be able to appraise a study's limitations when reading the 
literature, because it helps one to know how confident to be in the study's 
findings.
It's also essential to be able to appraise the potential limitations of a
during the planning stages; this helps us to make better decisions about 
experiment design, and it helps us to develop realistic expectations of what 
the study will deliver once it is conducted.

### Learning about limitations

You can learn a certain amount about a published study's limitations by reading the 
paper's 'Discussion' section. It is good practice for Discussion sections
to include a substantive discussion of the study's potential limitations.
Of course, the original authors will typically have some incentive to present
their paper in a good light, so they may not be comprehensive in their 
self-criticisms, but nonetheless this is a good place to start.

Review articles, and to a certain degree textbook chapters, are another good 
place to look for insight into a study's limitations. Such articles will 
have a broader view of the field and will typically provide some kind of 
comparative perspective on the different methodologies available to that field.
However, not all such articles have the space to really dive into the details
of individual articles.

The best resource for understanding a study's limitations comes when you can 
find a published commentary on that study. Only a minority of papers end up
receiving published commentaries, but when they do exist they can be very 
useful. These commentaries tend to be published by different authors from the 
original study, and tend to manifest alternative viewpoints to the original 
authors. Some journals (e.g. 'Behavioral and Brain Sciences' and 
'Empirical Musicology Review') actively solicit commentaries and publish them
alongside the original published article. Some journals (e.g. eLife, PeerJ)
publish original peer reviews alongside published articles, serving a similar
purpose.

Another great way to develop an appreciation of studies' limitations is to 
attend research presentations and journal clubs. When authors present work
at scientific conferences or at university seminars, they typically have a 
Q&A session afterwards where the attendees will typically debate the
implications and limitations of the presented work. This is a good opportunity
to see how the research community responds to a given work. Of course, such 
Q&A sessions are typically constrained by politeness, and audience members 
may not feel comfortable in voicing their full criticisms. Journal clubs 
are a nicely complementary venue; in a journal club the members discuss a 
given paper in the absence of the original author, giving them freedom to 
deliver honest verdicts without worrying too much about being polite.
Have a look for such sessions in your own university: for example, the 
Centre for Music and Science at Cambridge runs a regular public seminar series
(https://cms.mus.cam.ac.uk/cms-seminars)
as well as an internal journal club.
