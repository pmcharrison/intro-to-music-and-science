<p><em>Descriptive statistics</em> are numbers that summarise key aspects of a given dataset. These statistics often form integral parts of particular visualisations (Chapter <a href="data-visualisation.html#data-visualisation">24</a>); for example, the median and interquartile range are two important statistics in box-and-whisker plots. In this chapter we will discuss various kinds of descriptive statistics and their applications.</p>

<p>We will now consider various descriptive statistics that can be computed for this variable.</p>
<div id="centrality" class="section level3">

<span class="header-section-number">25.1.1</span> Centrality<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#centrality"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>‘Centrality’ statistics describe the location of a dataset’s centre. There are three classic centrality statistics: the <em>mean</em> (also known as the ‘average’), the <em>median</em>, and the <em>mode</em>.</p>
<div id="mean" class="section level4">
<h4>
<span class="header-section-number">25.1.1.1</span> Mean<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#mean"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<p>We compute the mean of <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> datapoints by summing them together and dividing by <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>. In mathematical notation, we can write the following:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\textrm{mean}(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_N) = 
\frac{x_1 + x_2 + \ldots + x_N}{N} = 
\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N{x_i}
\]</span></p>
<p>For example, the mean of 6.47, 2.32, and 1.57 is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\frac{6.47 + 2.32 + 1.57}{3} = 3.453
\]</span></p>
<p>Let’s compute the mean of our larger dataset and plot it on our histogram.</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="148-quantitative-v-descriptive_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="100%"></div>

<h4>
<span class="header-section-number">25.1.1.2</span> Median<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#median"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<p>The median is computed as follows: we rank the data points in numeric order, and then take the middle data point. For example, suppose that we want to compute the median of the following numbers:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
5, 2.5, 8.3, 7, 1.2
\]</span></p>
<p>We first arrange them in ascending order:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
1.2, 2.5, 5, 7, 8.3
\]</span></p>
<p>We then select the middle number:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
1.2, 2.5, \mathbf{5}, 7, 8.3
\]</span></p>
<p>So, our median will be 5.</p>
<p>If we have an odd number of values, there will be exactly one number in the middle. If we have an even number of values, there will be exactly two numbers in the middle. In this case, we take the two middle values and average them to get the median.</p>
<p>Let’s add the median to our histogram:</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="148-quantitative-v-descriptive_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="100%"></div>
<p>In this example the median is significantly smaller than the median. This is commonly the case with <em>skewed</em> distributions. Skewed distributions can often be found in socioeconomic studies; for example, income distributions tend to have the majority of incomes bunched towards the bottom of the distribution, contrasting with a smaller number of much higher incomes towards the top of the distribution. This yields the paradoxical situation that the ‘average’ person earns less than the average income.</p>

<p>Alongside centrality, it is useful to characterise the <em>spread</em> of our dataset. There are various relevant statistics here, including the range, standard deviation, and interquartile range.</p>
<div id="range" class="section level4">
<h4>
<span class="header-section-number">25.1.2.1</span> Range<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#range"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<p>The range simply corresponds to the difference between the highest and the lowest values observed in the dataset. Suppose we have the following dataset:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
5, 3, 2, 4, 3
\]</span> The minimum value is 2, and the maximum value is 5, so the range is 3.</p>
<p>The range is often described as an unreliable statistic because it is highly sensitive to outliers, that is, rare extreme values in the distribution. The following two statistics are however less sensitive to such outliers.</p>
</div>
<div id="standard-deviation" class="section level4">
<h4>
<span class="header-section-number">25.1.2.2</span> Standard deviation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#standard-deviation"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<p>The standard deviation can be informally understood as the average distance of each observation from the mean. We can compute it in R using code like the following:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb34"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="va">x</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html">c</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="fl">5</span>, <span class="fl">3</span>, <span class="fl">2</span>, <span class="fl">4</span>, <span class="fl">3</span><span class="op">)</span></span>

<span><span class="co">#&gt; [1] 1.140175</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The mathematical definition of standard deviation has some subtleties, though.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The ‘average’ here is computed by taking the ‘root mean square’ (i.e., taking the distances from the mean, squaring them, adding them, then taking the square root).</p></li>
<li><p>By default, we compute what is called the ‘sample standard deviation’, which has a built-in adjustment factor to account for uncertainty in the mean. The result is that the definition of standard deviation has <span class="math inline">\(n-1\)</span> in the denominator (the lower part of the fraction) rather than <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The mathematical definition of the standard deviation is then:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
s = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}(x_i - \bar{x}) ^ 2}{N-1}}
\]</span></p>
<p>Here <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> refers to the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>th value in the dataset, and <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span> refers to the mean value in the dataset. The sigma notation ()</p>
<p>If you are unfamiliar with this kind of mathematical notation, you may wish to have a look at Section <a href="computational-music-psychology.html#a-note-on-mathematical-notation">28.3.3.4</a>. Don’t worry too much, though: this mathematical definition is <strong>not</strong> required for the Cambridge undergraduate courses, and you are unlikely to need to worry about it in most situations.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">25.1.2.3</span> Interquartile range<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#interquartile-range"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<p>The interquartile range is another measure of spread. It is based on the concept of <em>percentiles</em>. The <em>x</em>-th percentile of a given dataset is the value below which <em>x</em>% of the sample falls. For example, the 25th percentile is the value below which 25% of the sample falls. We can compute percentiles in R with code like the following:</p>

<div class="inline-figure"><img src="148-quantitative-v-descriptive_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png" width="100%"></div>
<p>We compute the interquartile range as the difference between the 25th percentile and the 75th percentile. In this case, the interquartile range would be 290.4108358.</p>

</h3>
<p>Often we want to understand how certain pairs of variables relate to each other. In Chapter <a href="data-visualisation.html#data-visualisation">24</a> we learned various techniques for plotting such relationships. For example, we saw that pairs of continuous variables can be visualised using a scatter plot:</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="148-quantitative-v-descriptive_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png" width="100%"></div>
<p>A key descriptive statistic in this context (two continuous variables) is the <em>correlation coefficient</em>. The correlation coefficient is a way of quantifying the strength of the relationship between two variables.</p>
<p>A correlation of 1 means a perfect positive correlation, where the relationship between the two variables is perfectly summarised by a straight line with a positive (i.e. ascending) gradient:</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="148-quantitative-v-descriptive_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png" width="100%"></div>
<p>A correlation of -1 also means that the relationship is perfectly summarised by a straight line, but one with negative gradient:</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="148-quantitative-v-descriptive_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png" width="100%"></div>
<p>These cases may be contrasted with a correlation of 0, which corresponds to the absence of a relationship:</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="148-quantitative-v-descriptive_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png" width="100%"></div>
<p>Intermediate numbers between these values then correspond to noisy relationships. In a noisy relationship, one variable gives some information about the other variable, but not enough to perfectly predict it. Here we have an example of a correlation of 0.7:</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="148-quantitative-v-descriptive_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png" width="100%"></div>
<p>Here is a correlation of -0.4:</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="148-quantitative-v-descriptive_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png" width="100%"></div>
<p>There are different types of correlation coefficients out there. The most common is the <em>Pearson correlation coefficient</em>, which is what we’ve been plotting just now. This is the default used by most statistical software. In R, you can compute the Pearson correlation coefficient as follows:</p>

<span class="header-section-number">25.2.1.1</span> Outliers<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#outliers"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<p>A troublesome thing about the Pearson correlation coefficient is that it is rather sensitive to outliers (i.e. extreme data values). This will be illustrated with an example. Suppose we start with a dataset where the correlation coefficient is 0:</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="148-quantitative-v-descriptive_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-21-1.png" width="100%"></div>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb38"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">

<span><span class="co">#&gt; [1] 0.3015113</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now let’s add one outlier to this dataset, with a large x value and a large y value.</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="148-quantitative-v-descriptive_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-23-1.png" width="100%"></div>
<p>If we compute the correlation between these two variables, we find that it has now increased to a rather large number, despite the fact that the original dataset had no correlation at all:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb39"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/cor.html">cor</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">df2</span><span class="op">$</span><span class="va">x</span>, <span class="va">df2</span><span class="op">$</span><span class="va">y</span><span class="op">)</span></span>
<span><span class="co">#&gt; [1] 0.6667556</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>There are fortunately other types of correlation coefficient that are <em>robust</em> to these kinds of issues. These are called <em>non-parametric</em> correlation coefficients (this contrasts with the Pearson coefficient, which is a <em>parametric</em> coefficient). Two such coefficients are particularly popular: the <em>Spearman</em> and the <em>Kendall</em> correlation coefficients. These coefficients both also give numbers between -1 and 1. They are, however, much less sensitive to outliers. Let’s see what they return for our dataset:</p>

<p>All else aside, many statisticians prefer the Pearson correlation coefficient because it has certain useful statistical properties. However, it is a good idea to use a non-parametric coefficient if one is worried about outliers.</p>

<p>It is important to note that correlation coefficients only look for <em>increasing</em> or <em>decreasing</em> relationships. They do not look for more complex shapes. For example, the following curve illustrates a situation where <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> is perfectly predicted from <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, yet the correlation coefficient is 0:</p>

<p>The Pearson correlation coefficient is particularly picky in that it looks specifically for <em>straight</em> lines (in statistics lingo: <em>linear relationships</em>). So, the following curve has a Pearson correlation coefficient less than 1:</p>
